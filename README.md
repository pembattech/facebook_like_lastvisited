# facebook_like_lastvisited

This project demonstrates how to implement Facebook-like session tracking in a Laravel application. The application remembers the last section a user visited and automatically redirects or scrolls them back to that section when they return.

## Features

- **Session Tracking:** The application tracks the last section visited by the user and stores it in the database.
- **Automatic Redirection:** Upon login, the user is redirected to the last section they visited.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** The page scrolls smoothly to the last visited section after page load.
